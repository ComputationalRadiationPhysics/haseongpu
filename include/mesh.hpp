/**
 * @brief Contains the structure of the crystal
 *
 * All the fixed values of how the crystal is meshed
 *
 * points The coordinates of the triangle vertices
 *        All x coordinates followed by all of the y coordinates of the triangle vertices
 *        structure: [x_1, x_2, ... x_n, y_1, y_2, ... y_n] (n == numberOfPoints)
 *
 *
 * betaVolume beta values for all prisms ordered accordingly to the prismIDs:
 *            prismID = triangleID + layer * numberOfTriangles;
 *            therefore, all betaVolume for a layer are grouped together
 *
 * normalVec the normal vectors for each triangle edge
 *           first half (size: 3*numberOfTriangles -> one for each side) contains
 *           the x components of each vector, second half contains the y components.
 *           the each half is ordered as follows:
 *           [ triangle1edge0, triangle2edge0, ... triangleNedge0, triangle1edge1, triangle2edge1, ... ]
 *           i.e. all first edges of each triangle, followed by all second edges of each triangle and so on.
 *
 * centers the coordinates of the center points for each triangle
 *         All x coordinates followed by all y coordinates of the triangle vertices
 *         similar to "points"
 *
 * triangleSurfaces the sizes of the surfaces of each triangle, ordered by the triangleID
 *
 * forbiddenEdge  describes the relation of edge indices of adjacent triangles
 *           -1 means, there is no adjacent triangle to that edge
 *           0,1,2 describes the index of the edge as seen from the ADJACENT triangle
 *
 *           order of data is similar to normalVec:
 *           [ triangle1edge0, triangle2edge0, ... triangleNedge0, triangle1edge1, triangle2edge1, ... ]
 *           i.e. all first edges of each triangle, followed by all second edges of each triangle and so on.
 *
 * trianglesPointIndices contains the indices to access the "points" datastructure 
 *           (each triangle has 3 points as vertices). Each entry is an
 *           index from 0 to numberOfPoints, corresponding to the positions 
 *           of a vertex in "points".
 *           structure is similar to "forbiddenEdge":
 *           [ triangle1A, triangle2A, ... triangleNA, triangle1B, triangle2B, ... triangleNB, triangle1C, ... ]
 *           i.e. for triangles with vertices A,B,C there are all the indices
 *           of the A-vertices, followed by all the B and C vertices.
 *
 * triangleNeighbors describes the relation of triangle indices to each other.
 *           Each entry corresponds to a triangleID (see "trianglePointIndices") which
 *           is adjacent to the current triangle.
 *           structure is similar to "forbiddenEdge":
 *           [ triangle1edge0, triangle2edge0, ... triangleNedge0, triangle1edge1, triangle2edge1, ... ]
 *
 * triangleNormalPoint contains indices to the x and y components of the positions where the
 *             normalVectors start (see normalVec). For each Triangle 3 points (3 sides)
 *             are stored in this list.
 *             Indices point to locations in "points" (i.e. normal vectors start at
 *             triangle vertices!)
 *             structure is VERY similar to trianglePointIndices: 
 *             [ triangle1p0, triangle2p0, ... triangleNp0, triangle1p1, triangle2p1, ... ]
 *
 * refractiveIndices [0]->bottomInside, [1]->bottomOutside, [2]->topInside, [3]->topOutside
 * 
 * reflectivities Contains the reflectivities for upper and lower surface of gain medium
 *                Structure is based on 2 layers of triangles:
 *                [refl_tri1_bott, refl_tri2_bott, ...,refl_triN_bott, refl_tri1_top, refl_tri2_top, ..., refl_triN_top]
 * 
 * totalReflectionAngles [0]-> bottomTotalReflectionAngle, [1]-> topTotalReflectionAngle
