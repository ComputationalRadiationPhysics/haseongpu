## Descrition ##


## Dependencies ##

   Software:
   + make
   + gcc 4.4.1
   + cuda 5.0
   
   Hardware:
   + Nvidia device >= Compute capability 2.0

## Installation ##

   run : make

## Usage ##

   Usually you run this programm by a matlab script, that does
   the whole magic stuff for you. But you can also run it by hand,
   see synopsis for details.

## Synopsis ##

   Command:
     ./octrace [OPTIONS] 

   Options:
    --experiment=
      The absolut path to the experiment location.
      This folder contains several .txt files usually
      generated by an matlab script. The content of this
      .txt files contains all experiment data you need
      to run one experiment.

    --mode=[for_loops|ray_propagation_gpu]
      Defines the runmode/algorithm to start the
      simulation with. Mode "for_loops" is the original
      algorithm based on single core cpu. Mode "ray_propagation_gpu"
      is the parallel algorithm based on nvidia cuda
      devices.

    --rays=
      Sets the number of rays per sampled point in the
      crystal structure.

    --silent
      Don't print so much debug information.

    --device=
      Sets the device number by hand. Maybe you have several
      devices on you node and you want to choose a special one
      by device number.

    --compare=
      Is the location of a .vtk file with that you want to compare
      your solution. It is good to recognize stastical differences
      between different rays counts.
