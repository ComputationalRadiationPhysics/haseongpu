    slice indices(levels) and rows are point
    indices. The value for the ith point and jth 
    slice can then be optained by MATLAB with:
    	  
	  value = values(i,j);


### Input argument description ### 
    In the following all arguments of the MATLAB call are described.
    You will find on each point a head with datatype (an array when
    in brackets []), the size of the array and to which set of
    numbers the array belongs.

   * points [float], in {0, ..., numberOfPoints}, size = numberOfPoints
     The coordinates of the triangle vertices. All x coordinates followed by all
     of the y coordinates of the triangle vertices
     structure: [x_1, x_2, ... x_n, y_1, y_2, ... y_n] (n == numberOfPoints)

   * trianglePointIndices [int] in {0, ..., numberOfPoints}, size = numberOfTriangles * 3
     Contains the indices to access the "points" datastructure 
     (each triangle has 3 points as vertices). Each entry is an
     index from 0 to numberOfPoints, corresponding to the positions 
     of a vertex in "points".
     Structure as follows:
     [ triangle1A, triangle2A, ... triangleNA, triangle1B, triangle2B, ... triangleNB, triangle1C, ... ]
     i.e. for triangles with vertices A,B,C there are all the indices
     of the A-vertices, followed by all the B and C vertices.

   * betaCells [float]
     Stimulus in the sample points.

   * betaVolume [float], size = numberOfTriangles * numberOfLevels - 1
     Stimulus in the volume (prisms).
     Beta values for all prisms ordered accordingly to the prismIDs:
     prismID = triangleID + layer * numberOfTriangles.
     Therefore, all betaValues for a layer are grouped together

   * claddingCellTypes [int], size = numberOfTriangles
     Sets cladding index for triangles {0,1,2,...}

   * claddingNumber unsigned, size = 1
     Set which cladding to use

   * claddingAbsorption float, size = 1
     Absorption coefficient of cladding

   * useReflections bool, size = 1
     Switch to activate reflections.

   * refractiveIndices [float], size = 4
     Describes the refractive indices of the active
     gain medium top and bottom planes.
     It is structured as follows:
     {bottomInside, bottomOutside, topInside, topOutside}
     bottomInside = topInside (because it is the same medium)

   * reflectivities [float], in {0, ...,1}, size = 2 * numberOfTriangles
     Defines the reflectivities of prism planes.
     First the reflectivities of bottom plane and then the reflectivities
     of top plane. Both it ordered by TriangleID.

    * triangleNormalsX [float], size = numberOfTriangles * 3
     The x coordinate of the normal vectors for each triangle edge.
     It is ordered as follows:
     [ triangle1_edge0, triangle2_edge0, ... triangleN_edge0, triangle1_edge1, triangle2_edge1, ... ]
     i.e. all first edges of each triangle, followed by all second edges of each triangle and so on.

   * triangleNormalsY [float], size = numberOfTriangles * 3
     The y coordinate of the normal vectors for each triangle edge.
     It is ordered as follows:
     [ triangle1_edge0, triangle2_edge0, ... triangleN_edge0, triangle1_edge1, triangle2_edge1, ... ]
     i.e. all first edges of each triangle, followed by all second edges of each triangle and so on.

   * triangleNeighbors [int], in {-1,0,1,2,4}, size = 5
     Describes the neighnor relation of triangles to each other.
     Each entry corresponds to a triangleID (see "triangles") which
     is adjacent to the current triangle and edge.
     Structure is similar to "forbidden":
     [ triangle1_edge0, triangle2_edge0, ... triangleN_edge0, triangle1_edge1, triangle2_edge1, ... ]

   * triangleSurfaces [float], size = numberOfTriangles
     The sizes of the surfaces of each triangle, ordered by the triangleID.

   * triangleCenterX [float], size = numberOfTriangles
     The x coordinates of the center points for each triangle
     ordered by TriangleID.

   * triangleCenterY [float], size = numberOfTriangles
     The y coordinates of the center points for each triangle
     ordered by TriangleID.

   * triangleNormalPoint [unsigned], in {0, ...,  numberOfPoints}, size = numberOfTriangles * 3
     Contains indices to the point where the
     triangleNormalVectors start. For each Triangle 3 points (3 edges)
     are stored in this list. Indices point to locations in "points" 
     (i.e. normal vectors start at triangle vertices!)l
     Structure is VERY similar to triangles: 
     [ triangle1_p0, triangle2_p0, ... triangleN_p0, triangle1_p1, triangle2_p1, ... ]

   * forbiddenEdge [int], in {-1,0,1,2,4}, size = 5
     Describes the relation of edge indices of adjacent triangles
     -1 means, there is no adjacent triangle to that edge
     0,1,2 describes the index of the edge as seen from the ADJACENT triangle
     Order of data is similar to normalVec:
     [ triangle1_edge0, triangle2_edge0, ... triangleN_edge0, triangle1_edge1, triangle2_edge1, ... ]
     i.e. all first edges of each triangle, followed by all second edges of each triangle and so on.

   * minRaysPerSample unsigned, size = 1
     Minimal number of rays for adaptive sampling

   * maxRaysPerSample unsigned, size = 1
     Maximal number of rays for adaptive sampling
 
   * mseThreshold float, size = 1
      Sets the maximal MSE of the ASE value.
      If a sample-point does not reach this MSE-threshold, the number 
      of rays per sample-point will be increased upto maxRaysPerSample or
      resampled with repetitive sampling.

   * repetitions unsigned, size = 1
     Sets the number of maximal repetitions when the
     mseThreshold was not reached.

   * nTot float, size = 1
     Doping of the active gain medium

   * thickness float, size = 1
     Thickness of one prism level of the mesh.

   * laserParameter [float] 
     Is a structure for the laser parameters (wavelength sigmas)
     struct(s_abs, VALUES, s_ems, VALUES)

   * crystal [float]
     Is a structure for the crystal parameters 
     crystal.tfluo describes the crystalFluorescence of the active gain medium.

   * numberOfLevels unsigned, size = 1
     Total number of levels of the mesh. Thus the total thickness
     of the mesh is thickness * numberOfLevels!

   * runmode
     -> 'mpi'      use mpi to distribute workload (use nPerNode)
     -> 'threaded' use pthreads to distribute workload locally
     -> 'cpu'      use cpu algorithm (does not have all features)

   * maxGpus unsigned, size = 1
     Maximal number of GPUs for threaded case

   * nPerNode
     Number of devices per mpi-node


## Synopsis ##

   Command:
     ./bin/calcPhiASE [OPTIONS] 

   Options:
    --input
      Absolut path to the experiment location.
      This folder contains several .txt files usually
      generated by an matlab script. The content of this
      .txt files contains all experiment data you need
      to run one experiment.
    --output
      Absolute path to a writable location.
      Is used to write vtk files and input for
      matlab script.

    --runmode=[cpu|threaded|mpi]
      Defines the runmode/algorithm to start the
      simulation with. Mode "cpu" is the original
      algorithm based on single core cpu. Mode "threaded"
      is the parallel algorithm based on nvidia cuda
      devices with Pthreads. Mode "mpi" is a parallel mpi
      implementation for clusters.

    --rays=
      Sets the minimum number of rays per sample-point in the
      crystal structure.

    --maxrays=
      Sets the maximal number of rays per sample-point. The number
      of rays per sample-point will vary between minimum and
      maximum number of rays in dependance of a MSE-Threshold.
      (see --mse-threshold)

    --compare=
      Is the location of a .vtk file with that you want to compare
      your solution. It is good to recognize stastical differences
      between different rays counts.

    --write-vtk
      Write phiASE, dndtASE, mse, totalRays for every sample a .vtk file in
      the output subdirectory output/vtk/ should be created in advance.
      
    --maxgpus=
      Set the maximum number of gpus. "mpi" mode should set this
      to 1 and "ray_propagation_gpu" to the maximum number
      of Gpus on the node. If you don't set it, it will
      be set to the maximum automatically.

    --min_sample_i=
      Index of the first sample point (normally 0).

    --max_sample_i=
      Index of the last sample point (numberOfSample - 1).
          
    --verbosity=
      Add the following for different verbosity levels:
      0  : quiet
      1  : error
      2  : warning
      4  : info
      8  : statistics
      16 : debug
      32 : progress-bar

    --reflection
      Use reflection on upper and lower plane of gain
      medium. Maximal number of reflections will be
      calculated

    --mse-threshold=
      Algorithm tries to stay under this threshold
      by adaptive and repetitive sampling.

    --repetitions=
      Number of repetitions, that will be done
      when mse-threshold was not met.
