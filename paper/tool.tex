\section{The Tool}
To reach a wide range of scientist, a MATLAB interface is provided. Once
you included the file ``run\_octrace.m'' into your MATLAB path, you'll be able
to call the run\_octrace function. See into the README file or the provided
example code for interface details.

\subsection{Features}
\begin{itemize}
  \item polychromatic (multiple wavelengths)
  \item reflections on top and bottom of amplifying medium
  \item variable + adaptive number of rays per sample point
  \item multigpu on one computation node
  \item threshold for MSE
  \item creation of VTK files containing $\Phi_{ASE}$, reflections per prism etc.
  \item comparison with existing VTK files 
\end{itemize}
