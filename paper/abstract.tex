We present an adaptive Monte Carlo approach for computing the amplified
spontaneous emission (ASE) flux in large size laser gain media pumped by pulsed
lasers. Computations are based on a GPU algorithm with large speedup compared to
previously existing solutions, capable of simulating the upcoming generation of
high-power laser systems.
