\page gol The Game of Life Example

The following figure shows a sketch of the game of life
simulation implemented with GrayBat support.  The Game of
Life domain (20 x 20 cells) is decomposed very fine grain, such that,
every cell is represented by a vertex in a two-dimensional grid and
neighboring vertices are connected by edges (graybat::pattern::GridDiagonal). The graph is partioned
into four partitions and mapped to four peers (graybat::pattern::GraphPartition). Therefore, each peer is
responsible for the communication of 100 vertices with its
neighbors. Finally, each two peers are mapped to a quad core processor
on a dual socket system (graybat::communicationPolicy::BMPI). This is one possible sequence of mappings for a Game of
Life simulation within the GrayBat framework. On each step changes are possible
to adapt the simulation to other architectures, networks or
algorithms.
