\begin{frame}{Introduction}
  This template is based on the popular \LaTeX{} Beamer class. It tries to
  mimic the official presentation template outlined in the corporate design
  guidelines (\url{https://www.fzd.de/pls/rois/Cms?pNid=2220}).\\[1ex]
  Some minor settings such as additional logos or the document font can be
  adjusted in the heading section of this document's source file.\\[1ex]
  The directory {\tt LaTeX-Beamer} should be used as the master. Make a copy of
  it for every new presentation.\\[1ex]
  Please mail suggestions, improvements or feature requests to
  \url{a.grahn@hzdr.de}.\\[1ex]
